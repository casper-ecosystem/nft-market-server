## Server

A basic Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) & a few npm plugins.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Firebase

The Firebase secret key is not included here since it would give full admin rights to my account. So you will need to set up your own Firebase account / DB at https://firebase.google.com/ and generate a new private key to use in the app.
